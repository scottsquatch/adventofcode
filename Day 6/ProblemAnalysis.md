# Day 6
## Objective
Find the largest non infinite area of closest points to a given point. Distance is to be calculated using Manhattan Distance.
Note that this area does not include points which are tied in distance with other points.

## Given
A list of x,y coordinates

## Analysis
### Finding unbounded points
~~Any point that is on the outsides is unbounded. The only way I know to find these points is convex hull. See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-1-jarviss-algorithm-or-wrapping/ for explanation of Convex Hull~~
The above plan is a bit overkill.

A more simple plan is to create a bounding rectangle using:
xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax
