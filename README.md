# AdventOfCode

https://adventofcode.com/

Contains solutions to the problems for each of the advent of code days written in Java.

These were all written by me, except for a couple of cases where the code was heavily influenced by other sources; these should be noted in the code. Most notably:
* DFS/BFS algorithms were taken from Sedgewick's Algorithms book.
* Day 23 algorithm was taken from https://raw.githack.com/ypsu/experiments/master/aoc2018day23/vis.html, with modifications made to make it more "OOP" style.

Overall I thought it was a fun and challenging. It really requires a good grasp of data strcutrures and algorithms to finish each problem efficiently.
